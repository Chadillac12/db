# Project Overview

This repository now includes an ARINC-629 ICD Browser Streamlit app under `icd_browser/` alongside the existing comparison tooling.

- Streamlit ICD Browser: see `icd_browser/README.md` and run `streamlit run icd_browser/icd_streamlit_app.py`.
- **Requirements Builder**: Use `build_requirements_db_v2.py` (v2) with `run_config_v3.yaml`. The older `build_requirements_db.py` has been archived.
- Other utilities and scripts remain unchanged in their original locations.

Use the specific README within each tool’s folder for setup and usage details.
